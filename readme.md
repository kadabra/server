# Kadabra

### Start Making Magic

Kadabra is a realtime backend that's ready to go, so you can focus on your frontend.

Create an instant server with admin panel:

```sh
npm i -g @kadabra/server
kadabra
```

Then on your frontend, use the [kadabra client](https://github.com/kadabra/client). 

### Options

`kadabra --here` or `kadabra -H` to run kadabra in the current folder instead of globally.

`kadabra --noopen` or `kadabra -N` to suppress opening admin panel 

### Roadmap

We're currently at version **0.9.2**. See the [changelog](changelog.md)
