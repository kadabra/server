# Kadabra

### Start Making Magic

Kadabra is a realtime backend that's ready to go, so you can focus on your frontend.

Create an instant server with admin panel:

```sh
npm i -g @kadabra/server
kadabra
```

Then on your frontend, use the [kadabra client](https://github.com/kadabra/client). 

### Options

Include `-global`, `--global`, or `-G` to run kadabra globally instead of in the current folder.

Include `-open`, `--open`, or `-O` to open the admin panel (localhost:7777) for you.

### Roadmap

We're currently at version **0.9.2**. See the [changelog](changelog.md)
